#### **Group Problems:**

So far, our group is experiencing minimal problems. It is still early on, but one of our group members has yet to respond to our chat about the project and thus, has made zero contributions. If this changes, no action is needed. However, if nothing changes, a discussion with the instructor may be warranted about this member's participation.
