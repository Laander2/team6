This GitHub file includes an analysis of our audience for the proposed document and a general outline of our project. 

## Audience Profile

Andy Dwyer, who plans to attend The University of Mississippi in the Fall of 2017, worries about managing his time between classes, social time, and work while beginning his first year of college. Like Andy, most college students struggle with managing their time and are prone to using technology rather than paper and pen. ClassScheduler is a program that utilizes plug-ins from a university’s website to help students enter their semester course load and find balance between school and personal time. Once a student has selected the semester or quarter that he or she is entering, the program blocks out any personal time that may be needed for jobs, homework, napping, meals, and socialization. Additionally, the ClassScheduler program avoids scheduling conflicts and closed sections so that students are less likely to overbook themselves. While staying organized and having one’s life scheduled before him or her, the program offers personal designing options to make the schedule more appealing to the student’s eye. Previous users of ClassScheduler have stated that they preferred their personal design over the design that their university’s website offered. A limitation to using the ClassScheduler program is that maintenance on the plug-in may be required dependent on when a university’s website was last updated. Academic websites change frequently and with each change maintenance will be imperative in order for the ClassScheduler program to work properly. ClassScheduler is a free and easy program that students can use without the stress of having to fill in a planner but instead have the option of easily accessing this program to help make one’s life more organized. If students have an issue with operating the ClassScheduler program, they may want to refer to our simple how-to instructions for guidance on using ClassScheduler.  

## Project Outline

* For this document, it seems best fit to break our material into folders and use shorter, more numerous files rather than one longer file. 
* As for our use of multimedia content, it may be necessary to show screenshots of the program to supplement our intstructions; however, that has not completely been determined and set upon yet, and we will readdress the use of multimedia as we continue developing our document. 
* At this moment, there are no external sources or links that we need to include, but it is possible that we will use information from the ClassScheduler's project website, if necessary: [ClassScheduler Resource] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/personalclassscheduler/?source=typ_redirect)
* Provide general outline of the content, including 
  * How the document will be introduced
  * The order of presentation of the instructions
  * How many steps/units of the process
  * Which demonstration examples will be used.
