# Team 6: Document Outline 

This GitHub file includes an analysis of our audience for the proposed document and a general outline of our project. 

## Audience Profile

Andy Dwyer, who plans to attend the University of Texas at Arlington in the Fall of 2017, worries about managing his time between classes, social time, and work while beginning his first year of college. Like Andy, most college students struggle with managing their time and are prone to using technology rather than paper and pen. ClassScheduler is a program that utilizes plug-ins from a university’s website to help students enter their semester course load and find balance between school and personal time. Once a student has selected the semester or quarter that he or she is entering, the program blocks out any personal time that may be needed for jobs, homework, napping, meals, and socialization. Additionally, the ClassScheduler program avoids scheduling conflicts and closed sections so that students are less likely to overbook themselves. While staying organized and having one’s life scheduled before him or her, the program offers personal designing options to make the schedule more appealing to the student’s eye. Previous users of ClassScheduler have stated that they preferred their personal design over the design that their university’s website offered. A limitation to using the ClassScheduler program is that maintenance on the plug-in may be required dependent on when a university’s website was last updated. Academic websites change frequently and with each change maintenance will be imperative in order for the ClassScheduler program to work properly. ClassScheduler is a free and easy program that students can use without the stress of having to fill in a planner but instead have the option of easily accessing this program to help make one’s life more organized. If students have an issue with operating the ClassScheduler program, they may want to refer to our simple how-to instructions for guidance on using ClassScheduler.  

## Project Outline

* For this document, it seems best fit to break our material into folders and use shorter, more numerous files rather than one longer file. 
* As for our use of multimedia content, it may be necessary to show screenshots of the program to supplement our intstructions; however, that has not completely been determined and set upon yet, and we will readdress the use of multimedia as we continue developing our document. 
* At this moment, there are no external sources or links that we need to include, but it is possible that we will use information from the ClassScheduler's project website, if necessary: [ClassScheduler Resource](https://sourceforge.net/projects/personalclassscheduler/?source=typ_redirect)
* Our general outline is as follows: 

**_Title:_** Using ClassScheduler to Make a Personal Schedule
 
 1. **_Introduction of the Document_**
    * To hook our audience into reading our instructions, we need to use our introduction to convey the benefit of using such a program in college, such as explaining the importance of time management in college classes or maybe even, using our experience as college students to obtain credibility with these incoming students. 
    * Before doing so, however, we need to specifically state who should be carrying out the task outlined in our document and what resources they will need to carry out our task. 
 2. **_Step by Step Instructions_**
    * Our instructions will follow the sequence in which information is presented on ClassScheduler, and instructions for each section will be developed:
         * Schools
         * Sessions
         * Personal Times
         * Departments
         * Available Courses
         * My Courses
         * Find Feasible Schedules
    * In total, we should include _no less than_ 7 instructional steps. 
    * If we use multimedia content for demonstration examples, we would include a screenshot of ClassScheduler's main program page, and it would be included on a "main page" that we develop... possibly the introduction file? If we needed to include screenshots of certain sections, they would be placed on corresponding section files.  
3. **_Conclusion_**
    * To conclude our document, we need to ensure that the reader has somehow completed the task correctly. We could do this by using a screenshot of a sample schedule made through ClassScheduler. Then, we can explain each element that the student should see on their own schedule. 
    * It would be ideal to include a troubleshooting section to the conclusion of our document, but we are unsure that we know enough information about the program to troubleshoot, or know where to find such information, and unsure that we are as  technologically savvy as we need to be to make such a section to our document.
