## Team Charter

#### **Broad Team Goals:**

#### **Personal Goals:**
* Alix:
   1. Throughout the course of the project, I would like to have a productive and friendly team environment and experience.
   2. I would like my contribution to the project to be considered equal and fair, ensuring that everyone's voice is heard and understood. 
   3. Also, I would like to improve my markdown skills, as well as my technical writing skills. 
* Marcianne:
   1. I'd like for the group work and environment to be equally divided, constructive, and friendly as possibly. 
   2. Additionally, I would like to improve my technical writing skills. 
* Maia: 
   1. In the duration of this project, I would like to play an active and effective role towards the group. Now that I have downloaded the apps for Slack and GitHub, I will be able to quickly access this material.
   2. I would like to be able to communicate effectively with my group members; so, that we will do well on this project.
   3. In this project, I would also just like to further improve my wriitng and technical skills.

#### **Individual Commitment:**
* **Alix:** As decided by Marcianne and myself, I plan to serve as team leader for this project. Additionally, I plan to make an equal contribution with 100 percent effort, and only put more effort forth as needed to ensure a satisfactory grade. 
* **Marcianne:** I'm willing to put my best effort into this project and do whatever is asked of me. Despite my timing restrictions, I'm willing to work around those to the best of my abilities for the sake of obtaining a satisfactory grade and being fair to my group. 
* **Maia:** I will put 100 percent effort into this project and do my part as a team member. Whatever I need to do to perform as well as I can and also to help the group do as well as we can, I will do. 

#### **Other Concerns:**
* Alix:
   1. In addition to classwork, I work at the Writing Center and at Bramlett Elementary School; so, I have very limited hours to meet with other group members. However, I am always available via Slack or email. 
   2. Additionally, this means that I have a set schedule as to when I can work on the project; so, I need assignments to be handed out and delegated to other team members at the beginning of the week. 
   3. I have never completed a project on GitHub before, or even worked with GitHub; so I have very limited experience in this area, but I will work hard to learn. 
* Marcianne:
   1. I also work at the Writing Center Monday-Thursday and have class Tuesday and Thursday so my schedule is limited as well.
   2. My weeks both this first week and the week before spring break end on thursdays due to mandatory commitments that I have to be out of town for by Friday.
   3. I prefer to know by the beginning of the week about assignments and do not have any experience with GitHub but am prepared to learn and work on these assignments to the best of my capabilities. 
* Maia: 
   1. I have never used Slack or GitHub, and I had trouble at first with figuring it out. However, I was able to understand how to operate it, and hopefully, there will not be any more issues with these sites.
   2. Like every other college student, I have a busy schedule throughout the week. However, I will be easy to contact now that I have the apps, and I will make sure to check the groups frequently. 

#### _Conflict Resolution:_ 

If we are faced with a conflict that does not resolve itself within 24 hours and after careful consideration and respectful discussion among group members, we have decided to adopt a "majority rules" policy; members will be asked to vote on the issue, and the majority decision will be adopted.  

#### _Missed Deadlines:_ 

In the event that a team member misses a deadline, the team leader will send a "reminder" email or Slack message to said team member. If the team member does not respond within 24 hours, the instructor and remaining team members will be notified of the circumstance for opinions on how to progress.  

#### _Unacceptable Work:_ 

To decide what constitutes unacceptable work, all completed work will be submitted to other team members. Then, the suggested revisions from those team members and the document itself will be sent to the team leader. From there, it is the team leader's responsibility to develop a list of concerns from the suggestions and contact the original team member who completed the work. A new deadline will be set (typically 48 hours) to allow them to make revisions to the document. If at any point, the team member is confused or concerned about why their work has been deemed unacceptable, it suggested that they seek outside assistance (such as the Writing Center) and contact the team leader for additional information and progress updates.
