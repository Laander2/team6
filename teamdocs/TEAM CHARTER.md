#### **Individual Commitment:**
* **Alix:** As decided by Marcianne and myself, I plan to serve as team leader for this project. Additionally, I plan to make an equal contribution with 100 percent effort, and only put more effort forth as needed to ensure a satisfactory grade.

#### **Other Concerns:**
* Alix:
   1. In addition to classwork, I work at the Writing Center and at Bramlett Elementary School; so, I have very limited hours to meet with other group members. However, I am always available via Slack or email. 
   2. Additionally, this means that I have a set schedule as to when I can work on the project; so, I need assignments to be handed out and delegated to other team members at the beginning of the week. 
   3. I have never completed a project on GitHub before, or even worked with GitHub; so I have very limited experience in this area, but I will work hard to learn.
