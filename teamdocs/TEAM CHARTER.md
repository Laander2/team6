#### **Personal Goals:**
* Alix:
   1. Throughout the course of the project, I would like to have a productive and friendly team environment and experience.
   2. I would like my contribution to the project to be considered equal and fair, ensuring that everyone's voice is heard and understood. 
   3. Also, I would like to improve my markdown skills, as well as my technical writing skills.

   1. I'd like for the group work and environment to be equally divided, constructive, and friendly as possibly.

#### **Individual Commitment:**
* **Alix:** As decided by Marcianne and myself, I plan to serve as team leader for this project. Additionally, I plan to make an equal contribution with 100 percent effort, and only put more effort forth as needed to ensure a satisfactory grade. 
* **Marcianne:** I'm willing to put my best effort into this project and do whatever is asked of me. Despite my timing restrictions, I'm willing to work around those to the best of my abilities for the sake of obtaining a satisfactory grade and being fair to my group.

#### **Other Concerns:**
* Alix:
   1. In addition to classwork, I work at the Writing Center and at Bramlett Elementary School; so, I have very limited hours to meet with other group members. However, I am always available via Slack or email. 
   2. Additionally, this means that I have a set schedule as to when I can work on the project; so, I need assignments to be handed out and delegated to other team members at the beginning of the week. 
   3. I have never completed a project on GitHub before, or even worked with GitHub; so I have very limited experience in this area, but I will work hard to learn. 
* Marcianne:
   1. I also work at the Writing Center Monday-Thursday and have class Tuesday and Thursday so my schedule is limited as well.
   2. My weeks both this first week and the week before spring break end on thursdays due to mandatory commitments that I have to be out of town for by Friday.
   3. I prefer to know by the beginning of the week about assignments and do not have any experience with GitHub but am prepared to learn and work on these assignments to the best of my capabilities.
