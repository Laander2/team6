# Sample Team: Document Outline 

This file contains the analysis of the audience for the document as well as the general outline of the project. 

## Audience Profile
Please re-read pages 57-63 from *Practical Strategies for Technical Communication* to brush up on what goes into an audience profile. The infographic on page 60 may be helpful. 

### Specifications for Audience Profile
> **Length:** Variable; should equivalent to 250 words 
> **Format:** Variable; may be narrativem, diagram, chart, or something similar.  
> **Content**: The audience Profile should contain at least the following information
* Use case scenario for a specific member of the audience (detailed: John Smith at UM in a WRIT 100 class in Fall 2018, etc) 
* Technical background and competencies of audience demographic (you may need to back this up with a source. Check out [Pew Internet Foundation](http://www.pewinternet.org/) for data. 
* Limitations of the proposed document for the audience. 

## Project Outline
Review pages 403-520 in *Practical Strategies for Technical Communication* to brush up on guidelines for instructions and examples. 

For an example of a full documentation set in Github, see: https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation 
Your project will not be this extensive. However, your outline should do the following:
* Specify overall organization of documentation (will you break up into folders folder or just individual files? Will you use longer files or shorter/more numerous files?) 
* Specify use of multimedia content (screenshots, videos, other images)
* Specify preliminary external links and sources that you may want to include
* Provide general outline of the content, including 
  * How the document will be introduced
  * The order of presentation of the instructions
  * How many steps/units of the process
  * Which demonstration examples will be used.
