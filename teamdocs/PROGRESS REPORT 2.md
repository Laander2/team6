#### **Group Problems:**

Thus far, our group is experiencing issues with delegating assignments to one another. We had an issue this week where we thought there were going to be three parts, contigent on a member completing her portion. Once the member completed her portion, we realized the third portion was not as extensive or as necessary as it was thought to be. So, we, then, tried to delegate the other portion into two parts; so, each member was contributing equally. However, it was late in the week, and we were unable to get in touch with a member about this redelegation. Therefore, only two members were able to contribute to this week's work.    

#### **Late Status Reports:**

* Each group member has checked in.
